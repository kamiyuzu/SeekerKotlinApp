# Seeker Kotlin app

This app requires a [custom backend](https://github.com/kamiyuzu/SeekerBackend) with phoenix + postgresql database running for working properly.

This app explores a lot of Kotlin Android features. Has some hardcoded values like the backend IP, which will need to change based on the end network host IP. Moreover, it is screaming adding some dependency injection solutions like [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android). To wrap it all up, the amount of time invested as a university subject project this should be more than enough.
